# GraphQL and Kubernetes Example

Very simple project showcasing the basic concepts of a Kubernetes micro service architecture that is set up using Kustomize Kubernetes configuration files found in the [kubernetes](kubernetes/) folder with `dev` and `prod` example environments.

The project has basic CRUD operations for mutating and quering documents containing information of mammals in South Africa.

This kubernetes set up uses the following base concepts:
 - Pod with one container
 - Pod with multiple containers
 - Deployment
 - Ingress
 - Services
 - Secrets (with .env file and Kustomize)
 - Namespacing (`dev` and `prod`)

A diagram illustrating the project architecture.

## Running the project locally

The docker images are pushed to a local repository set up at `localhost:5000`. You can run a local registry using the docker registry image.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
```

Build the images

```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Publish the images to `localhost:5000`
```bash
$ ./publish.sh
```

To create the kubernetes locally you will need to use `kind` and `minikube` and deploy the cluster
```bash
# 'dev' can be changed to 'prod'
$ ./deploy.sh dev
```

 - The `dev` graphql API can be accessed at `http://heinvde-staging.mammals/graphql`
 - The `prod` graphql API can be access at `http://heinvde.mammals/graphql`

#### Minikube

To use the ingress controller with minikube you will need to use the add on and then run the deploy script
```bash
$ minikube addons enable ingress
```

To get the IP of minikube for the `dev` environment see the `address` value for `mammals-ingress` from this command
```bash
$ kubectl get ingress -n dev
```

To run the graphql API using through the ingress controller you need to update the hosts file to include the following lines (for linux)
```bash
# /etc/hosts
<ip-of-ingress>    heinvde-staging.mammals
<ip-of-ingress>    heinvde.mammals
```

#### Kind

To run this API with kind locally you have to setup an NGINX ingress according to [this](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/ingress/#ingress-nginx) and then run the deploy script.

To run the graphql API using through the ingress controller you need to update the hosts file to include the following lines (for linux)
```bash
# /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1    heinvde-staging.mammals
127.0.0.1    heinvde.mammals
```

## Services and API

The API and Services can run and be tested separately by referring the each README.
